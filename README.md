# Simulation-of-Transit-method
Our aim is to see which approach is better for teaching  the Transit method for Undergrad and advanced high school students and also to give them hands-on experience. We simulate the star-planet system in VPython and record its video. Tracker software works as a satellite which analyses the video and generate the data in terms of time and flux. We then use the csv file of this data and run python algorithms on it to look for exoplanet and derive its parameters. We also analyse the same data using Tracker built-in tools and get the parameters. We then compare the obtained results by both the approaches to the VPYTHON code's input parameters for our system and state the conclusion
